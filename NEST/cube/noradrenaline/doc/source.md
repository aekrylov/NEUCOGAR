5.	***Gregory_A._Ordway,_Michael_A._Schwartz,_Alan_Fraz(BookSee.org)*** "In addition, using electrophysiology we found that stimulation of the rat medial PFC (ACC area) activates noradrenergic LC neurons via a glutamate input (Figure 7.10)." – ***p.215***
6.	***Gregory_A._Ordway,_Michael_A._Schwartz,_Alan_Fraz(BookSee.org)*** "Gamma-aminobutyric acid has a tonic inhibitory effect on the LC and regulates levels of norepinephrine in the cerebral cortex. Iontophoretic application of GABA to the LC reduces LC firing.33 Focal electrical stimulation of the GABAergic PrH inhibits the discharge of neurons in the LC, an effect that is blocked by local infusion of a GABAA receptor antagonist.34 The infusion into the LC of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, or bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, decreases or increases, respectively, the levels of norepinephrine in the medial prefrontal cortex." – ***p.56***

8.	***Gregory_A._Ordway,_Michael_A._Schwartz,_Alan_Fraz(BookSee.org)***  "Kawahara et al. note that neurons of the LC appear to be phasically regulated by the activation of muscarinic receptors since the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, was without significant effect.35 M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic-binding sites have been described in the rat LC.49 Acetylcholine appears to excite LC neurons by acting at non-M1 muscarinic receptors." - ***p.57***
9.	***Gregory_A._Ordway,_Michael_A._Schwartz,_Alan_Fraz(BookSee.org)*** "Both 1- and 2-adrenergic receptors play a role in mediating noradrenergic regulation of serotonin release in the raphe as well as in raphe projection areas. Generally, 1-adrenergic receptors stimulate serotonin release, while 2-adrenergic receptor activation inhibits release" – ***p.59***
10.	***Gregory_A._Ordway,_Michael_A._Schwartz,_Alan_Fraz(BookSee.org)*** "The excitation induced in the ventral tegmental area by stimulation of the LC is attenuated by pretreatment with prazosin, an antagonist at 1-adrenergic receptors. Hence, norepinephrine appears to play a direct role via the ventral tegmental area in regulating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and limbic cortical regions, thereby indirectly influencing reward, emotional and cognitive states." – ***p. 60***
