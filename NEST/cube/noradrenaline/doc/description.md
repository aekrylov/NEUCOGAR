##Description condensed noradrenaline's schema
- ***Motor cortex.***
Motor cortex sends stimulate signal for receptor of noradrenaline located in locus coeruleus [LC], using glutamate.

- ***Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [BNST]***
Cholinergic innervation to BNST is supplied by the latero-dorsal tegmental nucleus, while cholinergic of BNST innervations to Amygdala. Glutamatergic inputs to the BNST originate from neurons located in the prefrontal cortex and regulated activity of GABA. The activity of BNST neurons is regulated by GABAergic inputs from both intrinsic sources. 

- ***Raphe nuclei [RN]***
Both 1- and 2-adrenergic receptors play a role in mediating noradrenergic regulation of serotonin release in the raphe as well as in raphe projection areas. 

- ***Perirhinal cortex [PrH] and Nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis [PGi].***
Prominent afferents to the LC include the nucleus paragigantocellularis (PGi) and the ventromedial aspect of the prepositus hypoglossi (PrH) in the rostroventrolateral and dorsomedial medulla, respectively. These nuclei provide strong excitatory and inhibitory influences on LC neurons, respectively, and are also sources of several neurotransmitter inputs to the LC nucleus. Stimulation of the PGi strongly excites LC neurons. In contrast, strong inhibition is produced by PrH stimulation. That inhibitory input also arises from the PGi is revealed when the strong glutamate input is antagonized pharmacologically.

- ***Lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus [LDT]***
LDT received signal on alpha1 and alpha2 â€“ adrenergic receptor from LC. Source of cholinergic input to the LC was identified in the LDT and they stimulate activity NE neurons.

- ***Nucleus tractus solitarii [NTS].***
Caudal NE neurons are separated from the LC complex and are located in the medullary ventrolateral reticular formation (A1,A2). The strong ascending projections of these NE cells to forebrain areas such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (into GLUT receptor of BNST), nucleus accumbens (into GABA receptor), and amygdala have now been shown also to be important in affective and cognitive processes.

- ***Locus coeruleus [LC]***
The striatum just has a small amount of NE, receiving only scattered fibers from the LC. Nonetheless, these striatal afferents seem to possess a high turnover rate. Stimulation DA neurons of VTA increases the activity of the LC, receiving signal on D1/D2 receptors and further exposure on them. The main afferents to the LC include projections from the prefrontal cortex (activates noradrenergic LC neurons via a glutamate), lateral hypothalamus, raphe nuclei, and amygdale. Furthermore, the LC receives NE afferents from lower medullary A1 and A2 regions. In addition, LC receives DA afferents from VTA. Alpha1 - adrenergic receptor, received signal from LC, has a great influence in most DA neurons activity of the VTA. PFC activates noradrenergic LC neurons via a glutamate. Inside there is an underlying inhibitory effect of prefrontal activation when the more potent glutamate-mediated excitation is antagonized. Gamma-aminobutyric acid has a tonic inhibitory effect on the LC and regulates levels of norepinephrine in the cortex.
